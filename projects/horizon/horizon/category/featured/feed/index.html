				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="CM_Callout">A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed. London was a city that allowed him to flourish expressively without the restrictions he felt were imposed on him in Peru. During the early nineties, Testino looked to his childhood growing up in Peru and his teenage summers in Brazil for inspiration.</div>
<p>I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. Until the advent of such technology, photographs were made by exposing the light sensitive photographic film, and used chemical photographic processing to develop and stabilize the image. By contrast, digital photographs can be displayed, printed, stored, manipulated, transmitted, and archived using digital and computer techniques, without chemical processing.</p>

<p>Make your content more appealing to your visitors by placing images in your text.  Fashion photography has been in existence since the earliest days of photography. In 1856, Adolphe Braun published a book containing 288 photographs of Virginia Oldoini, Countess di Castiglione, a Tuscan noblewoman at the court of Napoleon III. The photos depict her in her official court garb, making her the first fashion model.</p>

<p>In the first decade of the 20th century, advances in halftone printing allowed fashion photographs to be featured in magazines. Fashion photography made its first appearance in French magazines such as <em>La mode practique</em>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_200" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="wp-image-200 size-full" src="http://horizon.bycolormelon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/small-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" srcset="http://horizon.bycolormelon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/small-1.jpg 480w, http://horizon.bycolormelon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/small-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Left-aligned image</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1909, Condé Nast took over Vogue magazine and also contributed to the beginnings of fashion photography. In 1911, photographer Edward Steichen was “dared” by Lucien Vogel, the publisher of Jardin des Modes and La Gazette du Bon Ton, to promote fashion as a fine art by the use of photography. Steichen then took photos of gowns designed by couturier Paul Poiret.</p>
<p>These photographs were published in the April 1991 issue of the<a href="/beautiful-typography/"> magazine <em>Art et Décoration</em></a>. According to Jesse Alexander, This is “…now considered to be the first ever modern fashion photography shoot. That is, photographing the garments in such a way as to convey a sense of their physical quality as well as their formal appearance, as opposed to simply illustrating the object.”</p>
<p><i>Vogue</i> was followed by its rival, <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i>, and the two companies were leaders in the field of fashion photography throughout the 1920s and 1930s. House photographers such as Edward Steichen, George Hoyningen-Huene, Horst P. Horst and Cecil Beaton transformed the genre into an outstanding art form.</p>
<p>In the mid-1930s as World War II approached, the focus shifted to the United States, where <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Harper’s</i> continued their old rivalry. In 1936, Martin Munkacsi made the first photographs of models in sporty poses at the beach. Under the artistic direction of Alexey Brodovitch, <i>Harper’s Bazaar</i> quickly introduced this new style into its magazine.</p>
<p>House photographers such as Irving Penn, Martin Munkacsi, Richard Avedon, and Louise Dahl-Wolfe would shape the look of fashion photography for the following decades. Richard Avedon revolutionized fashion photography — and redefined the role of the fashion photographer — in the post-World War II era with his imaginative images of the modern woman.<br />
Paris, the main fashion powerhouse of the time quickly became isolated from the United States—especially with French Vogue shutting down for a brief hiatus in 1940. With these changes, the photography.</p>
<h3>Blockquote</h3>
<p>Use blockquotes to display quotations. You simply need to select the text that you want to style as a blockquote and then click on the “blockquote” button that is located in your text editor.</p>
<blockquote><p>It takes a lot of imagination to be a good photographer. You need less imagination to be a painter because you can invent things. But in photography everything is so ordinary; it takes a lot of looking before you learn to see the extraordinary.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still-life Fashion is a kind of fashion photography whereas clothes, footwear, jewelry, headpieces, and other fashion accessories are featured with the absence of a live model. The object of Still Life Fashion is to display fashion pieces rather than having the distraction of a model.</p>

<p>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. <a href="/portfolio">Check out my portfolio by clicking here.</a> His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. &#8220;What&#8217;s happened to me? &#8221; he thought. It wasn&#8217;t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p>
